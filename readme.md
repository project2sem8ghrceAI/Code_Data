## About this project

Malware is a serious threat to the security of computer systems, and traditional signature-based methods are ineffective in detecting new and unknown malware samples.  As a result, there is a pressing need for effective malware detection systems that can identify and prevent malware from infecting systems. In this paper, we propose a malware detection system using deep learning. The proposed system uses a deep neural network to learn the features of malware samples and classify them into different categories. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system on a dataset of real-world malware samples and show that it achieves high accuracy in detecting malware.

The rapid increase in the use of computer systems and the internet has led to a rise in the number of malware attacks. Malware refers to malicious software that is designed to harm computer systems or steal sensitive information from them. Malware can be spread through various means, such as email attachments, downloads from the internet, or through vulnerabilities in software. In recent years, machine learning has shown great promise in various fields, including malware detection. Machine learning models can learn the features of malware samples and classify them into differentÂ categories.

Malware, or malicious software, is a significant cybersecurity threat that can cause severe damage to individuals, organizations, and society as a whole. As malware continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, traditional signature-based detection methods are becoming less effective. Machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, has shown great promise in improving malware detection accuracy and addressing the challenges posed by advanced malware. In this research paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing literature on malware detection using machine learning techniques. We discuss various types of machine learning algorithms, feature extraction techniques, and evaluation metrics used in malware detection research. We also highlight the challenges and limitations of using machine learning for malware detection, including issues related to data imbalance, feature selection, and adversarial attacks. Finally, we identify potential future directions for research in this field, including the use of deep learning, ensemble methods, for improving the accuracy, robustness, and interpretability of malware detection models.

This study investigated the effectiveness of machine learning techniques for malware detection. XGBoost Regressor showed the best result with an accuracy of 92.85%. Followed by Random Forest Regressor and CatBoosting Regressor with an accuracy of 92.64% and 92.51%. Other machine learning algorithms did not flair well while Lassos and Ridge regression performed the worst. The results showed that deep learning models, such as the ANN model with binary cross entropy loss and Adam optimizer, outperformed traditional machine learning algorithms with an accuracy of 96%. These findings have significant implications for the development of more effective malware detection systems.
